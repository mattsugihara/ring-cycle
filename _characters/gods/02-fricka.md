Goddess of marriage and ever the voice of reason. She objected *heavily* to Wotan using her sister to pay for the creation of Valhalla, ultimately resulting in Wotan stealing the ring from Albericht. She also objected to Sieglinde leaving Hunding to run off with her twin Siegmund, and Wotan promises Siegmund's death.
