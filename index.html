    There's just shy of 20 hours of opera across four parts. Getting familiar with each one before the night of will make it easier to follow along.

    There’s a bunch of them. Many of them are gods, some of them are humans, and others are something else.

    Wagner didn't invent the idea of music representing characters, actions, or concepts in music, but he used the hell out of it. People debate how many he used (or even if they can be counted like that), but here's roughly a hundred of them.

    There’s no getting around the fact that Hitler loved <i>The Ring</i>. Wagner wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Judenthum_in_der_Musik">an essay</a> attacking Jews. Very clearly, the Nibelung are a horrid caricature of Jewish stereotypes. On the other hand, Wagner had several Jewish friends and patrons. In <i>The Ring</i>, the only competent characters are women, ideas of traditional masculinity are finely skewered, and the very notion of capitalism is called into question. So, it’s complicated. Let’s explore that.
