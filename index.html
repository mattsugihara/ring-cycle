  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <p>
    There’s a bunch of them. Many of them are gods, some of them are humans, and others are something else.

  <h2>Leitmotifs</h2>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    There’s no getting around the fact that Hitler loved The Ring, and that Wagner is on record saying that jews are terrible. On the other hand, the only competent characters in The Ring are women, ideas of traditional masculinity is pretty well skewered, and the very notion of capitalism is called into question. So, it’s complicated. Let’s explore that.
