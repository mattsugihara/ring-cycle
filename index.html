  <h2>Synopses</h2>
  <p>
    There's just shy of 20 hours of opera across four parts. Getting familiar with each one before the night of will make it easier to follow along.

  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <p>
    There’s a bunch of them. Many of them are gods, some of them are humans, and others are something else.

  <h2>Leitmotifs</h2>
  <p>
    Wagner didn't invent the idea of music representing characters, actions, or concepts in music, but he used the hell out of it. People debate how many he used (or even if they can be counted like that), but here's roughly a hundred of them.

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    There’s no getting around the fact that Hitler loved The Ring, and that Wagner is on record saying that jews are terrible. On the other hand, the only competent characters in The Ring are women, ideas of traditional masculinity is pretty well skewered, and the very notion of capitalism is called into question. So, it’s complicated. Let’s explore that.
