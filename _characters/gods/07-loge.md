Loge is the demigod of fire. All the usual associations with the god of fire apply, unpredicatble, unreliable, hothead, etc. He's also Wotan's right hand man. He's the one who reassured Wotan that using Freia as payment to the giants Fasolt and Fafner for building Valhalla would be ok, as he (Loge) would find a suitable replacement payment for them before they came for payment.
