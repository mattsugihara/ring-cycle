Wotan (a.k.a. Oden) is the god of light, air, and wind. He commissions the giants Fasolt and Fafner to build Valhalla, and pays them with treasure (including the ring) that he steals from Alberich.

Despite being married to Fricka, the godess of marriage, he fathered a bunch of kids out of wedlock including the twins/lovers Siegmund and Sieglinde and all nine valkyries.

He carries with him a spear inscribed with each agreement he has made. His power is drawn from this spear. In *Siegfried*, the eponymous character breaks Wotan's spear in the last moment Wotan is seen on stage for the remainder of the production.
