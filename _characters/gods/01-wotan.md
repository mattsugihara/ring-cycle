Wotan (a.k.a Oden) is King of the Gods. He builds a castle for the gods, Valhalla, and initially pays for it by given the builders (the giants Fasolt and Fafner), his sister in law Freia. Wotan orders his servant Loge to search the world for something else to use as payment, landing on Alberich's treasure, including the ring.

After stealing the ring, Wotan is warned by Erda that the gods' time is ending.
